## hard links

These directories are hard links:

snet/
schemes/
spellfiles/

They are synched with snafu-py. If deleted here, they are deleted for snafu-py instead!
They are made using https://github.com/selkhateeb/hardlink
To remove them, use `hln -u [dir]` instead

Hard links are used to assist with github synching without maintaining multiple separate copies



## compiling interface.py with py2app

cd py
rm -rf dist             # maybe unnecessary?
sudo ./build_py2app.sh

* must be using python.org python, not Apple python




## notes on packaging/distribution nwjs app without SDK

* install phoenix-builder (https://github.com/evshiron/nwjs-builder-phoenix) if not installed locally
    * npm install nwjs-builder-phoenix --save-dev
    

* update nwjs/snafu version in package.json?

* set flag in app.js to nwjs-app

sudo rm -rf dist    # remove old version
npm run dist        # compile new version

* compiling nwjs breaks compiled python interface (dunno why)-- manually copy interface.app to compiled nwjs version
* might need to chmod +x interface in interface.app, but hopefully not
* manually remove large files? (dedyne.snet, BEAGLEdata.mat)
* zip up folder (use mac gui zip, smaller than terminal zip)
* ~ 338mb uncompressed, ~126mb compressed

** why isn't it copying all directories??? some are missing like /uploads /snet /scheme /spellfiles


## web version set-up

run ~/.update-snafu.sh on luke
if alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu-dev looks ok, run ~/.update-snafu.sh live

misc notes:
    - make sure "web" mode is enabled (see top of js/app.js)
    - py/rw, /snet, /schemes folders exist
    - all python packages are installed (networkx, scipy, etc)
    - /uploads and /output are  777
