## compiling interface.py with py2app

cd py
sudo ./build_py2app.sh

* must be using python.org python, not Apple python




## notes on packaging/distribution nwjs app without SDK

* install phoenix-builder (https://github.com/evshiron/nwjs-builder-phoenix) if not installed locally
    * npm install nwjs-builder-phoenix --save-dev
    

* update nwjs/snafu version in package.json?

* set flag in app.js to nwjs-app

sudo rm -rf dist    # remove old version
npm run dist   # compile new version

* compiling nwjs breaks compiled python interface (dunno why)-- manually copy interface.app to compiled nwjs version
* might need to chmod +x interface in interface.app, but hopefully not
* manually remove large files?
    snafu_demo_video.mov
    snet/dedyne.snet
* zip up folder (use mac gui zip, smaller than terminal zip)


## web version set-up

set flag in app.js
