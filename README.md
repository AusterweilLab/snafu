# snafu graphical user interface

SNAFU is a Python library for analyzing verbal fluency data and estimating networks from fluency data (see https://github.com/AusterweilLab/snafu-py).

This repo hosts the code for a graphical front-end to the Python library. You probably are looking for the pre-packaged version of the GUI available at http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu. This repo is primarily for people who want to contribute to the GUI code (i.e., make changes to it).

To run this code from source, you will need to install snafu for Python (link above) as well as nw.js (http://hwjs.io). Neither are included in this repo.
