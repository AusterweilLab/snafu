# snafu

GUI for semnet package (though much less extensive). This is the development version, it does not include `nwjs` required to run, 
nor does it include `semnet` binaries (you must download the `semnet` package separately and place the `rw` folder in `/py`). 
Actually that sounds complicated, why don't you just use the web version at http://alab.psych.wisc.edu/snafu? Or if you really want
the desktop version, e-mail me at zemla at wisc dot edu for help.
