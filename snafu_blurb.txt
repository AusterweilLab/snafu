SNAFU: The Semantic Network and Fluency Utility

The semantic fluency task (listing items within a category) is frequently used
in psychology by both reseachers and clinicians. Analysis of fluency
data is often done by hand, which is time-consuming and error prone. SNAFU
automates the computation of many commonly used metrics, including counting
perseverations, cluster size, switch count, and more.

In recent years, semantic fluency data has been used by many researchers to
infer the mental organization of semantic categories, such as animals. SNAFU
implements many algorithms that use fluency data to construct semantic
networks, a representation of how category members are organized within the
mind. SNAFU will compute several basic network measures (e.g., average node
degree, others) on these representations, and allow researchers to export these
networks for additional analysis.

SNAFU is intended primarily for research psychologists who wish to analyze
fluency data and compare the semantic networks of different groups or
individuals.
