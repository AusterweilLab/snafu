- Your data file should be a CSV file formatted like <a href="../uploads/results_cleaned.csv">this example</a>.
<br><br>

- You will need a header row with these columns (extra columns are ignoresd): id (subject id), listnum (list identifier), category (e.g., animals or letterF), and item (the participant's response).

- SNAFU can be picky about file encoding and is not very forgiving if you are missing cells in your spreadsheet
<br><br>

- Large networks may take some time to fit, especially with U-INVITE! Currently there is a loading icon, but no other progress indicator. If you've been waiting a few minutes, you could check error.log in the main directory. (On a mac, this file is buried within the .app for reasons beyond my control.) This is research software, and we make no guarantees that things will work as expected.

Some additional network parameters are not well documented. For example the "jump probability" and "priming probability" are likely to have large impacts on your network. Jump probability indicates the probability of taking a random jump to another node at any point in time. Priming probability is more complicated, but useful when lists are collected in a single session from a single participant (see Zemla & Austerweil, 2017 CogSci proceedings).
